FOLDER CONTENTS
---------------

This folder contains the slides and the outline I'll be following during the
workshop. Please bring the outline along at the very least.

INSTALLING ANACONDA
-------------------

You'll need to install the Miniconda distribution beforehand. Why? Because it
will probably take time to do during the workshop. If you'd like to know what
Miniconda is, check Section 0 in the outline.

1. Visit the Downloads page for Miniconda: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html#miniconda

2. Select the appropriate Python 3 version for your OS and download it.

3. To install, run the installer, and follow the instructions on-screen.

4. To verify that it has been installed sucessfully, open a Command Prompt
(Run > cmd) and type "python --version" without the quotation marks. You
should see a message quite similar to this: "Python 3.3.5 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc.".

5. In the Command Prompt, type "conda install ipython pyzmq jinja2 tornado". We will need
these packages to run IPython during the workshop.

HELP
